    "This data set shows the nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita of OEPD countries in US dollars from 1960 to 2022. The GDP is the standard measure of the value added created through the production of goods and services in a country during a certain period. The GDP per capita can be found by dividing the total GDP by its population. It also measures the income earned from that population, the total amount spent on final goods and services. This data set was created to be a part of a larger data set called the OECD Economic Outlook created by the OECD Economics Department.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data set has 8 columns: Location, Indicator, Subject, Measure, Frequency, Time, Value, Flag Codes). The Location column specifies the country. The Indicator column specifies what is being measured, which is GDP. This column would be helpful when accessing the larger data set, however, in this situation, since we are only accessing the GDP data set, this column is not necessary. The Subject column indicates the topic to which the data values in each row correspond to. In this dataset, since there is only one topic, the only value for this column is “Total GDP”. The Measure column specifies how the data was measured. In this case, the data was measured in US dollars/capita. The Frequency column is similar to the measure column and is used to filter out this specific data set from the larger data set. The Time column indicates what year each data value is from. The time ranges from the years 1960 to 2022. The Value column displays the nominal GDP per capita. The last column, Flag Codes, is used to indicate an error for each row.\n",

    "\n",
    "From the original data set, we removed the Indicator, Subject, Measure, Frequency, and Flag Codes columns. We also renamed the \"Location\" column as \"Country\" and the \"Time\" column as \"Year\" in order to be consistent with the previous data sets. We also renamed the \"Value\" column as \"GDP in US Dollars\". We also need to limit the years to be between the years 1995 to 2020 in order to be consistent with the previous data sets found and limit the amount of missing values in the data."

This data was created with the intention to facilitate the dissemination and use of comparative education statistics that will contribute to policies that results in better functioning and more effective education systems.\n",

The Indicator column specifies what is being measured, which is education expenses. This column would be helpful when accessing the larger data set (Education Spending), however, in this situation, since we are only accessing the total population data set, this column is not necessary. The Subject column indicates the topic to which the data values in each row correspond to. In this dataset, since there is only one topic, the only value for this column is “Tertiary”, meaning that is it not necessary to us. The Measure column just specifies how the data was measured, in this case, USD per student. The Frequency column is similar to the measure column and is used to filter out this specific data set from the larger data set. The Time Column indicates what year each statistic is from. The time ranges from the years 1995 to 2020. The Value column displays the average amount of money spent on tertiary education in US dollars per student. The last column, Flag Codes, is used to indicate an error for each row.\n",

From the original data set, we removed the Indicator, Subject, Measure, Frequency, and Flag Codes columns. We also renamed the \"Location\" column as \"Country\" and the \"Time\" column as \"Year\" in order to be consistent with the enrollment_rates_df. We also renamed the \"Value\" column as \"Average Spending on Higher Education (USD/student)\" in order to specify the value of it, which is needed when we combine all the data sets."

    "This data set shows government expenditures on education as a percentage of total GDP for all the countries in the world from 1980 - 2022. Government expenditure on education (% of GDP) is calculated by dividing the total government expenditure for all levels of education (early, primary, secondary, tertiary, etc.) by the GDP and multiplying by 100. All the data is based on World Bank median estimates. The data on education was collected by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics from official responses to its annual education survey. All the data are mapped to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) to ensure the comparability of education programs at the international level. The current version was formally adopted by UNESCO Member States in 2011. GDP data come from the World Bank.\n",

    "In the original data set, each row represents an OECD country, each column reflects the school year for which the data was presented, and each value in the data frame represents the percentage of GDP the government spent on education. In some countries, the school year spans across two calendar years, so in these cases, the reference year refers to the year in which the school year ended. There was also no header for the Country column. In order to be consistent with the format of the previous data sets, we melted the data set, added the header for the Country column, and mapped all the country names to their corresponding country codes. We also need to limit Years to be between 1995 and 2020 to be consistent with the previous data sets and limit the amount of missing values.\n",

    "Some government expenditure percentages might appear lower in some countries where the private sector (households) have a larger share in the total funding for education."

Similar to the previous factor of expenditures on education as a whole, this can help us analyze the impact of government support to people completing a higher education on percentage of population with a tertiary education. In addition, the percentage of total expenditures spent on tertiary education can also help quantify how important obtaining pursuing a higher education is to that specific country. If a country's people places an emphasis on higher education, we expect this to reflect in a higher percentage of total government expenditure allocated for higher education.   \n",

Household disposable income is available to households such as wages and salaries, income from self-employment and unincorporated enterprises, income from pensions and other social benefits, and income from financial investments.

The Subject column indicates the topic to which the data values in each row correspond to. In this dataset, since there is only one topic, the only value for this column is “Gross Adjusted”. The Measure column just specifies how the data was measured, in this case, gross household income per capita. The Frequency column is similar to the measure column and is used to filter out this specific data set from the larger data set. The Time Column indicates what year each statistics is from. The time ranges from the years 1950 to 2022. The Value column displays the total population for each country and year per millions of people. The last column, Flag Codes, is used to indicate an error for each row.\n",

This organization collaborated with other institutions of the Spanish R&D system, and with social, economic, national or foreign agents. The original data set has 7 columns: Country, Top 100, 101-500, 501, 1000, 1001-10000, and Total. The Country column lists all the countries in the world and each other category lists how many universities in each country fall in those rankings.\n",

When manually entering the data, we also made sure to format it in a way that wecould directly use the data set without cleaning it."
