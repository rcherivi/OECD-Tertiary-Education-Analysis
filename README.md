### Research Question: 

Of the factors like GDP, average income, number of private and public universities, etc. that can impact the percentage of the population with tertiary education in a country per year, which factors have more impact on the percentage of the population with tertiary education in OECD countries?


### Background Information:

In this project, we will observe the percentage of people in OECD countries who obtained a tertiary degree. Factors like the country's GDP per capita, average family income, average spending on higher education, the population of the country, how much the country spends on education, the total number of universities, and primary, secondary, and tertiary enrollment rates are all included as variables in this model. We will train a multivariate regression to see if we can reliably predict the percentage of the population with tertiary education. We will also look to see which combinations of factors minimize the total AIC and thus have a greater impact on the percentage of the population with tertiary education among the age groups of 25-34. We are trying to investigate this in order to inform the people interested in improving tertiary education rates on which areas to focus on and target. In addition, we want to see if the population with tertiary education stimulates the increase of other factors like GDP and household income. 

OECD stands for Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and is a group of countries with market-based economies that collaborate to promote sustainable economic growth. We chose countries that are part of the OECD to evaluate because they account for three-fifths of the world's GDP, have similar economic infrastructure, and the data available on OECD countries are more extensive than countries that donâ€™t participate in the OECD. Because of these similarities in its economic infrastructure, we decided that this group of countries would be easier to evaluate compared to attaining data from all 197 countries in the world. In addition, this list of countries consists of a wide range of economic development. Some countries like the USA and Great Britain, are more economically developed than other countries like Chile and Costa Rica. 

In the real world, there are many factors that seem to impact education levels such as local views on the benefits of education, the economic well-being of the country, and many others. By investigating this research question and isolating some quantitative factors that we think are very important factors that impact education, we want to be able to see whether increasing certain factors for the country can help to increase education rates since higher development and production often yield a population that is better off and can have the bandwidth to pursue higher education. In addition, we wanted to see if a greater number of resources available would result in a higher percentage of the population with tertiary education. To be more precise, we wanted to analyze if investing more spending in education and building more universities actually helps with improving tertiary education rates. 

Usually, higher education yields higher productivity as there are more people looking to optimize the work being done. Therefore, through the exploratory part of our project, we also look to see how variables such as GDP per capita, education enrollment rates, and household income change as tertiary education levels increase. This provides a very brief insight about whether having more people with higher education actually benefits the country's economy and the general population. 


### Summary of Findings:

After completing our analysis, there is weak or no evidence that GDP per capita and Government Expenditure On Education as a percentage of GDP is significant in influencing the ratio of population of ages 24-35 with a tertiary education. 

Expanding our analysis to all variables we used in our data frame, there was no variable that is statistically significant in our two versions of the lowest AIC model. Therefore, although we spotted trends and correlations in our graphs, we can not conclude that any of the variables has a significant impact on the proportion of population with tertiary education. This finding goes to show the strong interconnectedness of factors that impact education. This strong interconnectedness results in the small change in AIC (which can be used to compare how well models predict the response variable) during the process of adding and/or removing factors.

Although we expected factors like GDP per capita and government expenditure on education to have at least some relationship with the ratio of people with tertiary education, the limitations in the data frame with the large amount of NaNs and the delayed impact of the factors on the dependent variable may have affected our analysis.
