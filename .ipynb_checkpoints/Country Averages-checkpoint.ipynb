    "Now that the missing values have been removed, we can run linear regression models on the data. We will first run a linear regression model on all the input variables. Before creating the model, we will first normalize the input variables. Normalization ensures that all input features have the same scale. This is important because linear regression is sensitive to the scale of input features. Features with larger scales may have a disproportionately larger impact on the model, potentially overshadowing the contributions of features with smaller scales. To do this, we will create a function Normalizer that takes a set of columns and normalizes them using 'StandardScaler' from scikit-learn, and apply the function to the input variables. StandardScaler standardizes the features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. \n",

    "Then, we will split the data into training and testing sets. We will use the training set to train the model and the testing set to evaluate its performance. Following convention, the test_size parameter is set to 30%, meaning 70% of the data will be used for training and 30% for testing. The 'random_state' parameter ensures reproducibility."
