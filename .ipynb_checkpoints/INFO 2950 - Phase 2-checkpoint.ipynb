    "In this assignment, we will observe the number of people in OECD countries that complete their tertiary education. Tertiary education includes bachelor's and other kinds of higher levels of education. Factors like the country's GDP, GDP per capita, average family income, average tuition, the population of the country, how much the country spends on education, the number of public/private universities, and primary, secondary, and tertiary enrollment rates. are all included as variables in this model. We will train a multivariate regression to see if we can reliably predict the number of people graduating with their Bachelor's. We will also look to see which combinations of factors minimize the residual and thus have a greater impact/correlation on the number of Bachelor's degrees obtained. \n",

    "To provide some background, OECD stands for Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and is a group of countries with market-based economies that collaborate to promote sustainable economic growth. We chose countries that are part of the OECD to evaluate because they account for three-fifths of the world's GDP, and all have similar economic infrastructure and is more extensive than countries that don’t participate in in OECD. Most non-OECD countries are countries with developing economies or modernizing economies. Because of these similarities in its economic infrastructure, we decided that this group of countries would be easier to evaluate compared to attaining data from all 197 countries in the world.\n",

    "This data set shows the nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita of OEPD countries in US dollars from 1960 to 2022. The GDP is the standard measure of the value added created through the production of goods and services in a country during a certain period. The GDP per capita can be found by dividing the total GDP by its population. It also measures the income earned from that population, the total amount spent on final goods and services.\n",

The Indicator column specifies what is being measured, which is GDP. This column would be helpful when accessing the larger data set, however, in this situation, since we are only accessing the GDP data set, this column is not necessary. The Subject column indicates the topic to which the data values in each row correspond to. In this dataset, since there is only one topic, the only value for this column is “Total GDP”. The Measure column specifies how the data was measured. In this case, the data was measured in US dollars/capita. The Frequency column is similar to the measure column and is used to filter out this specific data set from the larger data set. The Time column indicates what year each data value is from. The time ranges from the years 1960 to 2022. The Value column displays the nominal GDP per capita. The last column, Flag Codes, is used to indicate an error for each row. \n",

We also renamed the \"Location\" column as \"Country\" and the \"Time\" column as \"Year\" in order to be consistent with the previous data sets. We also renamed the \"Value\" column as \"GDP in US Dollars\".\n",
    "We also need to limit the years to be between the years 1995 to 2020 in order to be consistent with the previous data sets found and limit the amount of missing values in the data."

The Measure column just specifies how the data was measured, in this case, the population per millions of people. The Frequency column is similar to the measure column and is used to filter out this specific data set from the larger data set. The Time Column indicates what year each statistics is from. The time ranges from the years 1950 to 2022. The Value column displays the total population for each country and year per millions of people. The last column, Flag Codes, is used to indicate an error for each row. \n",

The Subject column indicates the topic to which the data values in each row correspond to. In this dataset, since there is only one topic, the only value for this column is “Tertiary”, meaning that is it not necessary to us. The Measure column just specifies how the data was measured, in this case, USD per student. The Frequency column is similar to the measure column and is used to filter out this specific data set from the larger data set. The Time Column indicates what year each statistic is from. The time ranges from the years 1995 to 2020. The Value column displays the average amount of money spent on tertiary education in US dollars per student. The last column, Flag Codes, is used to indicate an error for each row. \n",

All the data are mapped to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) to ensure the comparability of education programs at the international level. The current version was formally adopted by UNESCO Member States in 2011. GDP data come from the World Bank. \n",

There was also no header for the Country column. \n",

This data was created with the intention to facilitate the dissemination and use of comparative education statistics that will contribute to policies that result in better functioning and more effective education systems. \n",

The Subject column indicates the topic to which the data values in each row correspond to. In this dataset, since there are multiple topics since all the data is split by different age groups (25-34 year-olds and 55-64 year-olds). The Measure column just specifies how the data was measured, in this case, a ratio of full-time students to teachers. The Frequency column is similar to the measure column and is used to filter out this specific data set from the larger data set. The Time Column indicates what year each statistic is from. The time ranges from the years 2013 to 2020. The Value column displays the ratio of students enrolled to teachers. The last column, Flag Codes, is used to indicate an error for each row. \n",

    "Our biggest issue when finding data was finding data that didn’t have a lot of missing values. A lot of the data that we did find, ended up having a lot of missing values in it. And since we cannot include Nan’s in our linear regression model we were forced to calculate the mean of the entire column and insert that in our missing entries. However, because of this, our Linear Regression model is not as accurate as it should have been. In the future, we will try to figure out a better method to fill in those data gaps instead of inserting the mean of the column. In addition, we had trouble finding long-range data. One of our really important data sets only has data from 1995-2020, and because of this, we had cut off the range of years to 1995 - 2020 even though all the other data sets had longer data ranges for the year.

One idea that we had was to find the NAs and manually input them using relevant data. For instance, for the Household Income per Capita"
